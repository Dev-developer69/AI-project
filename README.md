I have created a program which extracted data from Alibaba.com 
It uses Selenium, a python open-source automation tool primarily used for testing web applications and web scraping
using the selenium tool, I have extracted the following -
1.Title
2.Buyer
3.Buyer Image if available
4.Date posted
5.Quotes left 
and a few more 
I have extracted the data and saved in a csv file as alibaba.csv using the Pandas library of python 
In alibaba.csv, I have created columes for each data
